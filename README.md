# MarkovMelody - An Automated Music Pattern Generator Using Markov Models

Automated music pattern generation is a burgeoning area of research that combines artificial intelligence and computer music composition. This project presents a novel system for creating music patterns using Markov Models, allowing for real-time playback via a built-in Sine Oscillator and MIDI export for use with virtual instruments. The system captures sequential dependencies within a given musical dataset and generates coherent yet diverse music patterns. Implemented in the JUCE framework, the system demonstrates its effectiveness in producing musical sequences and discusses potential applications in music composition and creative exploration.
